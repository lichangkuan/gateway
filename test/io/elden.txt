The fallen leaves tell a story. 

落叶捎来讯息：

The great Elden Ring was shattered. In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between. 

在雾的彼端，我们的故乡“交界地”，那伟大的艾尔登法环已经破碎

Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish.

“永恒女王”玛莉卡销声匿迹，在黑刀阴谋之夜，“黄金”葛德文最先失去性命。

Soon, Marika’s offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering. A war from which no lord arose. A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.

玛莉卡之子──诸位半神拿到艾尔登法环的碎片，却因为那股力量堕入歧途、陷入疯狂、引发碎片战争……在那场无王存在的战争最后── 无上意志放逐了他们。

Arise now, ye Tarnished. Ye dead, who yet live. The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all. Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands. The ever-brilliant Goldmask. Fia, the Deathbed Companion. The loathsome Dung Eater. And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

噢，所以啊，褪色者啊── 依旧无法永眠的死者啊。那许久以前我们失去的赐福，正在出声呼唤。 “蛮荒地王者”荷莱·露、 光耀金面具、“死眠少女”菲雅、受尽唾弃的食粪者、 “百智爵士”基甸·奥夫尼尔。

And one other. Whom grace would again bless. A Tarnished of no renown. Cross the fog, to the Lands Between, to stand before the Elden Ring. And become the Elden Lord.

……那失去的赐福又再一次， 回到默默无名的褪色者身上。 朝雾的彼端前进，抵达交界地，觐见艾尔登法环，成为艾尔登之王吧。
